\title{Complementary Functions}
\description{
This set of complementary functions are wrappers around the database
functions that facilitate the use of the LegCo API or return data from the
API in a more usable form. All complementary functions have a prefix of
\code{search_}.
}
\section{Functions}{
 Complementary Functions: \itemize{ \item
  \code{\link{search_committee}}: Search LegCo committees \item
  \code{\link{search_member}}: Search LegCo members \item
  \code{\link{search_voting_record}}: Search Voting Record in LegCo meetings
  \item \code{\link{search_question}}: Search full text of question put to
  the government by LegCo members}
}

\section{Notes}{
 The complementary functions work by calling a number of
  database functions and combining their output, meaning that a function call
  usually involves multiple API calls. Use with caution to prevent reaching
  the APIâ€™s rate limit too quickly.
